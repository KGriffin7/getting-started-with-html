      <b>HTML Markup</b>
    <p>HTML markup is control by elements known as <em>tags</em> and <em>attributes</em>.<b>Tags</b> are used to alter the appearance of specific words or phrases. All tags are used in the middle of "<" and ">" To make a word <b>bold</b>, you would use the "b" tag and to <em>italize</em>, the "em" tag would be used.<b>Attributes</b> are complementary assets to some tags. An anchor tag, for example, would be accompanied by the attribute "href", while "src" or search would be used for an image or "img" tag.</p>
    <br>
